    <p>The Provo Tabernacle served as a tabernacle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1898 to 2010 in downtown Provo, Utah, United States. It is a historic icon of Provo and has been home to many religious and cultural events.[1] All but the outer walls of the building were destroyed by fire in December 2010. The LDS Church preserved the remaining outer walls and built a new foundation and interior as part of the Provo City Center Temple, completed in 2016..</p>

    <p>This now peaceful valley is the site of one of the most tragic meetings of two cultures that the state has ever experienced. At 1:00 am on January 29, 1863, an infantry of soldiers with all their weapons moved through the snow drifts into position to attack a band of 450 Shoshoni men, women, and children that had camped along the banks of the Bear River. The troops began the attack at the crack of dawn just as they  were lighting their first campfires. The Shoshoni lost nearly 275 people due to this cruel attack of the California Volunteers. The battle became one of the worst disasters for Native Americans in the west.</p>
